# Sprint Planning: Feature Scope to Executable Sprints

Break down your feature scope into value-first, executable sprints with version number.

**What this does:**
- Launches the `sprint-planner` agent
- Reads your `FEATURE_SCOPE.md` from latest convergence
- Considers existing issues from `ISSUES_TRACKER.md` (if present)
- Assigns version number (vX.Y.Z) using SemVer based on scope
- Creates 2-5 sprints (typically) with detailed breakdown
- Integrates high-priority issues into sprint plans where appropriate
- Defines TDD implementation order for each sprint

**Usage:**
- Takes 20-30 minutes
- Requires completed convergence session
- Best done right after `/convergent-dev:1-converge`

**Process:**
1. Agent reads your latest `convergence/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/FEATURE_SCOPE.md`
2. Agent reads existing issues from `.amplifier/convergent-dev/issues/ISSUES_TRACKER.md` (if present)
3. Determines version number (vX.Y.Z) based on scope:
   - Major (v2.0.0): Breaking changes
   - Minor (v0.2.0): New features, backward compatible
   - Patch (v0.2.1): Bug fixes only
4. Analyzes feature complexity and dependencies
5. Evaluates which tracked issues should be integrated into sprint work:
   - Critical/High priority issues that fit naturally with planned features
   - Issues that should be addressed before new feature work
   - Issues that can be deferred to later
6. Determines value-first sequencing
7. Breaks down into sprints (2-5 days each) with integrated issue work
8. Defines TDD implementation order
9. Creates detailed sprint documents

**🚨 MANDATORY Directory Structure:**
```
.amplifier/convergent-dev/sprints/vX.Y.Z-feature-name/
├── SPRINT_PLAN.md              # Overview
├── SPRINT_01_NAME.md           # Sprint 1 details
├── SPRINT_02_NAME.md           # Sprint 2 details
├── SPRINT_03_NAME.md           # Sprint 3 details
└── SPRINT_04_NAME.md           # Sprint 4 details (if needed)
```

**Real Example (see existing sprints)**:
- `.amplifier/convergent-dev/sprints/v0.1.0-template-system/`
- `.amplifier/convergent-dev/sprints/v0.2.0-chunked-generation/`

**All files MUST be inside the versioned directory - NOT directly in sprints/**

**Each sprint includes:**
- Duration estimate
- Clear deliverable
- Features included
- What's deliberately deferred
- Learning goal
- Acceptance criteria
- TDD implementation order
- Estimated complexity

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Confirmation of version number
- Confirmation of sprint breakdown
- Adjustments if needed

**After this:**
- Use `/convergent-dev:3-tdd-cycle 1` to start implementing Sprint 1
- Review sprint plans and adjust if needed
- Have clear implementation roadmap

**Philosophy:**
- Value-first sequencing (learning early)
- Vertical slices (end-to-end features)
- Realistic timelines (include test time)
- Clear deliverables per sprint

**Documentation:** See `ai_context/convergent-dev/SPRINT_PLANNING.md` for detailed guide.

**Ready? Let's turn your feature scope into executable sprints with version number.**

**What happens next:**

1. I will locate your latest `FEATURE_SCOPE.md` from convergence
2. I will launch the `sprint-planner` agent to analyze your scope
3. The agent will create detailed sprint plans with version number

**Launching sprint-planner agent now...**
